# Indoor-Dataset

The indoor dataset is collected using ZED-m camera for training and evaluating the network in real-time. The collected dataset is used for two objectives:
1. Predict depth maps for an indoor-environment scene.
2. Used predicted deph map for robot palletization (pick-n-place task).

## Task-1: Depth Maps for an Indoor Scene.
Using ZED-m camera multiple videos of the indoor scene (our workplace) is collected. From the video, stereo-rectified pair of images are obtained. We collected around 12,000 frames for training the network.
